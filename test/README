Test scripts for the GENI Account Request system

curl-request
============

Description
-----------

The `curl-request` script is available for submitting account requests
programmatically. It allows for customization of the minimal set of
parameters that must be unique to a request. If further customization
of requests is desired, `curl-request` can serve as an example for how
to submit requests via [`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/).

Usage
-----

The general form of the `curl-request` invocation is:

    curl-request <URL> <EMAIL> <USERNAME>

`curl-request` takes 3 parameters:
 * URL - the URL of the request handler
 * EMAIL - the email address for the request
 * USERNAME - the desired username for the request

Examples
--------

To create a single request:

    curl-request https://ar.example.com/geni/handlerequest.php \
        test20@example.com test20

To create multiple requests in a loop:

    export AR_URL='https://ar.example.com/geni/handlerequest.php'
    for i in 01 02 03 04 05; do
      echo ${i}
      curl-request "${AR_URL}" "test${i}@example.com" "test${i}"
    done
