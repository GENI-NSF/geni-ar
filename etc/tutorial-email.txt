<organizer_name>,

The temporary tutorial accounts for the <description> tutorial have been created.
They are:

  username: <username_prefix>NN
  password: <password_prefix>NN

where NN is the tutorial user number, from 01-<numaccounts>.

Each user will need to self-assert their email address when they first
log in to the GENI Portal. After supplying their address, each user
will receive an email to confirm their address before they can use the
Portal. Users should also modify their profile to provide their
correct full name.
